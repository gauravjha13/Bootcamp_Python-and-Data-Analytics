# ShapeAI_Bootcamp_Python-and-Data-Analytics
Titanic Datasheet Analysis

Using Google Colab, I made this project during the 7 Days Free Bootcamp,conducted by <b> SHAPEAI </b>.

Here is my work:-
Titanic_project.ipynb - Colaboratory (google.com)

The instructor during the session was Nandini Jalan (Ex- Intern at Google).
<br>
<br>During these 7 days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that
anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.
I enjoyed these 7 days, you can as well. To register for next free 7 days bootcamp, visit:
