# ShapeAI_Bootcamp_Python-and-Data-Analytics
Titanic Datasheet Analysis

Using Google Colab, I made this project during the 7 Days Free Bootcamp,conducted by <b> SHAPEAI </b>. The datasheet was provided by ShapeAI and using this data we had to predict whether a person survived the shipwreck or not.  0 for not surviving, 1 for surviving.

Here is my work:-

The instructor during the session was Nandini Jalan (Ex- Intern at Google).

During these 7 days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that
anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.
